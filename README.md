# La Fortuna Restaurant Website

This project is a website for "La Fortuna", an Asian restaurant located in Livorno. The website provides information about the restaurant, its menu, location, and allows users to place orders online.

- **Location**: Shows the restaurant's address, contact information, and a map for easy navigation.
- **Online Ordering**: Allows users to browse the menu and place orders directly through the website. The backend service handles order processing, including order confirmation and delivery scheduling.
