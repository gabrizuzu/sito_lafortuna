# sito_lafortuna
This project is realized for the Web Design's exam in Unipi.
The purpose of this project is to realize a full site for "La Fortuna Restaurant", based in Livorno (Italy).
In this site is also implemeted a function that allows the client to order directly from the site.
I used html, css and javascript for the front-side of the site, and for the part of back-end, in particulary the food-order management and admin management part is developed using php and sql.
Obviously there is a part dedicated for the management of the database.
